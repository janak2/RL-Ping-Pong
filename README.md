# RL-Ping-Pong

An example of Reinforcement learning using batch Q-learning.  
Once you run the code wait patiently until you see a yellow and purple square on a teal background. 
Click play in the button right below the square. 
This is a movie of a policy playing the game No Exit. 
It’s kind of like Pong: the purple square is the “ball” and the yellow square is your “paddle”. 
The actions are to move the paddle up, down, or keep it still.
